Nakshatra Tracker
---

This application is meant to show moon's position within a _nakṣatra_, an asterism, as defined in Hindu astrology.

Currently, the orientation of _nakṣatra_-s is the same as it would be when you were facing in the northern direction at the time of sunrise, typically 0655-0700.

**7th December, 2023:**

The application is highly inaccurate and only shows the moon's passage through a _nakṣatra_ every hour, without considering the actual position of the moon in sky and in the relative area of _nakṣatra_. The _nakṣatra_-s have also been evenly placed, each _nakṣatra_-image being 256x256 pixels, hence depicting a very wrong distance and are not to scale.

The update is hourly since updating every second is currently pointless in a 2D-plane and also the value is too small for tracking and maintenance.

Following are the goals and to-dos:

• Publish the application

• Redefine the space between _nakṣatra_-s and moon so that it more accurate than it is right now

• Incorporate better calculations for accurate results

• Add proper labels and other relevant information for better navigation and readability

• Make the application 3D. Basically a Stellarium app with _only_ relevant Hindu stars
