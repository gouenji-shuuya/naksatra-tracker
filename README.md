Nakshatra Tracker
---

This application is meant to show moon's position within a _nakṣatra_, an asterism, as defined in Hindu astrology.

Currently, the orientation of _nakṣatra_-s is the same as it would be when you were facing in the northern direction at the time of sunrise, typically 0655-0700.

**Margashirsha Krishnapaksha Dashami, 2023**

The application is highly inaccurate and only shows the moon's passage through a _nakṣatra_ every hour, without considering the actual position of the moon in sky and in the relative area of _nakṣatra_. The _nakṣatra_-s have also been evenly placed, each _nakṣatra_-image being 256x256 pixels, hence depicting a very wrong distance and are not to scale.

The update is hourly since updating every second is currently pointless in a 2D-plane and also the value is too small for tracking and maintenance.

Following are the goals and to-dos:

<li>Publish the application</li>

<li>Redefine the space between <em>nakṣatra</em>-s and moon so that it more accurate than it is right now</li>

<li>Incorporate better calculations for accurate results</li>

<li>Add proper labels and other relevant information for better navigation and readability</li>

<li>Make the application 3D. Basically a Stellarium app with _only_ relevant Hindu stars</li>
